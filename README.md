# :face_with_spiral_eyes: :sneezing_face: AllergyAlert :smiling_face_with_tear: :face_exhaling: 

## AllergyAlert is a web application designed to help users monitor allergens in their region. The app provides a list of active allergens based on the user's selected location and the number of days for the forecast. Users can view details about specific allergens, including images and additional information.

## üöÄ Performance Enhancement (September 2024 Update):
Caching: The application leverages <ins>**Microsoft.AspNetCore.ResponseCaching**</ins> to implement a 2-minute response caching mechanism for certain API endpoints, significantly improving performance on repeated calls. The first call usually takes around 1-1.5 seconds, while the second call benefits from caching, taking about 2 milliseconds. This update not only reduces latency for users, but also optimizes resource usage, leading to lower operational costs.
